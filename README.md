# presence

A typing test that doesn't care about your WPM.

Just you quote, and the quiet hum of your terminal.

Type the words. Notice the mistakes. Keep going anyway. The obstacle is the way.

## Run

```bash
go run .
```

Or build it and sit with the binary for a while:

```bash
go build -o presence && ./presence
```

## Controls

- **Type** — that's it, that's the app
- **Backspace** — for when the ego intervenes
- **Esc / Ctrl+C** — return to the world of distractions

## License

MIT — be present with it however you like.
